## About me

I am a data science and English double major in my fourth year at Macalester College in St Paul, Minnesota. Through my studies, I seek to bridge the gap between STEM and the humanities. My coursework has given me a strong foundation in in machine learning, data science, and programming alongside literary analysis and creative writing.

Stories have always shaped how I see the world. Growing up, my father and I had a weekly tradition: we would complete my math lessons together at the local bookstore, after which I could choose a new book to take home. As I flipped between novel chapters and math problems, I realized my passion lay in uncovering the stories hidden within both words and numbers. Today, this perspective drives my interdisciplinary approach to data science and writing.

My internship with the US Geological Survey allowed me to develop data skills in the context of my interest in environmental issues. I also interned with ReticManager, a software company supporting water-management infrastructure, where I developed my technical abilities in a professional setting. Most recently, research with Professor Sayamindu Dasgupta at the University of Washington has enabled me to explore the role of data storytelling in fostering data literacy.

Outside of the classroom, I am a captain of Macalester's club [quadball](https://www.mlquadball.com/what-is-quadball) team and an avid West Coast Swing dancer. In my free time, I also enjoy baking, hiking, and discovering new music.
