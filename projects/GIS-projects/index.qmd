This page showcases a selection of my GIS projects, demonstrating my ability to integrate data analysis, spatial techniques, and visual design.

## Exploring Public School Enrollment

I downloaded and cleaned TIGER/Line Shapefiles to create an address locator for geocoding public school addresses into a point layer. After verifying accuracy through rematching and formatting a common field, I attribute-joined enrollment data to these school points. I then acquired and filtered Census Tract shapefiles for St. Paul, joined them with age demographic tables to calculate the percentage of children aged 5 to 9, and exported the data for visualization.

For the final map, I used choropleth symbology with natural breaks to display the distribution of elementary school-aged children by tract. I performed a spatial join to aggregate school enrollment data by neighborhood and represented enrollment levels with graduated symbols. I completed the design with clear labels, a legend, and explanatory text, producing an effective visual comparison of population age distribution and school enrollments.

## Choosing an Appropriate Research Location

I used ArcGIS to identify suitable research station locations near global cities based on environmental and demographic criteria. I integrated UNEP/GRID datasets on cities, lakes, precipitation, and humidity, applying attribute selections to isolate dry sub-humid regions with â‰¤600mm annual precipitation. Using buffer and selection tools, I narrowed results to cities with under 500,000 people within 50 km of lakes. I exported selections into new layers, intersected them to identify areas meeting all criteria, and refined outputs using the clip tool for cartographic consistency. Finally, I designed a professional, executive summary-style map with labeled features, glow effects, and explanatory text for clarity. This project improved my skills in using ArcGIS for data integration, spatial analysis, and effective visual communication.
