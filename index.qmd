## About me

I'm a Data science and English double major in my second year at Macalester College. As a student, I endeavor to bridge the divide between STEM and the humanities. I have taken courses involving Python, object oriented programming, data science, and statistical modeling, as well as various literature and creative writing classes.

I hail from the suburbs of Chicago, where, in my free time, you could find me either in a ballet studio or with my nose in a book. Creativity has always been important to me; I have loved stories for as long as I can remember.

My father and I had a tradition of completing my math lessons at the bookstore every week, after which I was allowed to select a new book. 
Eventually, I realized that I love finding stories in numbers as well as in fantastical worlds. 


Nowadays, outside of the classroom, I am a captain of Macalester's club [quadball](https://www.mlquadball.com/what-is-quadball) team and an avid West Coast Swing dancer.
