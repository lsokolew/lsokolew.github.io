The game is displayed as an image in a separate window, while the user interacts through prompts in the console. We implemented the program by creating the visual component first, and then adding the ability to move pips according to user input.\nThis project was created by Avery Sinclair and Lilabeth Sokolewicz.\nRead our Final Report."

The goal is to obtain the key and go through the door to level up- but beware of spikes and bombs!\nI created the avatar and implemented its horizontal and vertical motion, including the ability to land on and fall off of platforms. I collaborated with peers, using GitHub, to apply our knowledge of object-oriented programming and give a presentation on our work.\nThis project was created by Courtney Brown, Sam Kenney, and Lilabeth Sokolewicz."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For this project, we worked with Macalester College’s Office of Institutional Research to examine the connection between students’ choices of majors and concentrations (similar to minors), as well as the implications of those connections. To present our findings, I learned how to create and format a Shiny App.\nOur investigation focused on how a student's declared major(s) impacts other academic focuses. For students, this can be useful to inform decision-making about potential concentrations given their declared major(s), given their benefits and accessibility. For faculty and administrators, it could be useful to be aware of the demographics of students who concentrate, so they know who to reach out to increase participation in concentrations. They also might consider changing the available concentrations or revising the requirements for existing ones.\nThis project was completed by Lilabeth Sokolewicz, Phoebe Thomas, and Mila Zhou.\nFind our interactive Shiny App and report here: https://lilabethsoko.shinyapps.io/FinalProjApp/\nR code is included in the index section."

My coursework has given me a strong foundation in in machine learning, data science, and programming alongside literary analysis and creative writing.\nStories have always shaped how I see the world. Growing up, my father and I had a weekly tradition: we would complete my math lessons together at the local bookstore, after which I could choose a new book to take home. As I flipped between novel chapters and math problems, I realized my passion lay in uncovering the stories hidden within both words and numbers. Today, this perspective drives my interdisciplinary approach to data science and writing.\nMy internship with the US Geological Survey allowed me to develop data skills in the context of my interest in environmental issues. I also interned with ReticManager, a software company supporting water-management infrastructure, where I developed my technical abilities in a professional setting. Most recently, research with Professor Sayamindu Dasgupta at the University of Washington has enabled me to explore the role of data storytelling in fostering data literacy.\nOutside of the classroom, I am a captain of Macalester’s club quadball team and an avid West Coast Swing dancer.

    "text": "In the multi-stage, semester-long project, we worked with data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, as well as from the American Community Survey.\nWe examined the impact of socioeconomic status and geographic region on energy use and efficiency, factors which underscore the importance of local and regional context in effective energy policy. Further, we found that using less space is key to decreasing energy usage; on average, higher-density housing like apartments use less energy than single family homes.\nI applied my GIS and R skills to create visually pleasing maps to effective display our geographic data, including the distribution of housing types, age, and size.\n\nThis app was created by Lilabeth Sokolewicz, Zoey Yandell, and Trung Dam.\nExplore the Shiny app with our report here."

    "text": "This data was released by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and contains details about the flight details and conditions for flights leaving MSP airport in 2022. After cleaning the data and selecting the value of lambda that produced the lowest cross-validation mean absolute error, we fit a linear regression LASSO model to select the best predictors for flight arrival delay.\nOur final model is fairly strong and accurate, and good at at predicting delays of flights within one hour. Since there is less data for flights delayed over an hour; however, the model does not perform well on more delayed flights.\nThis report was completed by Rishika Kundu & Lilabeth Sokolewicz.\nSee our work here"

    "text": "Using unsupervised learning techniques in R, we analyzed Spotify data to uncover similarities and differences between One Direction songs. Our dataset included various musical features like duration, danceability, tempo, and popularity metrics.\nUsing k-means clustering, we identified three distinct clusters of songs. Our PCA application revealed that the most influential features were energy, acousticness, Spotify popularity, and loudness. This created clearer cluster definitions and improved the interpretability of our results.\nMy dimension reduction work integrated with the team’s efforts, enabling us to retain about 75% of the data’s variance while reducing feature redundancy. This was crucial for achieving balanced and meaningful clusters.\nThis project highlights my proficiency in applying sophisticated machine learning techniques to real-world data, optimizing model accuracy, and deriving insights. I am excited to continue leveraging these skills to push the boundaries of data analysis and machine learning.\nThis project was completed by Grace Bettenburg, Bridget Foley, and Lilabeth Sokolewicz."
