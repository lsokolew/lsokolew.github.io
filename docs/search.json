    "text": "Our investigation focused on how a student's declared major(s) impacts other academic focuses. For students, this can be useful to inform decision-making about potential concentrations given their declared major(s), given their benefits and accessibility. For faculty and administrators, it could be useful to be aware of the demographics of students who concentrate, so they know who to reach out to increase participation in concentrations. They also might consider changing the available concentrations or revising the requirements for existing ones.\nThis project was completed by Lilabeth Sokolewicz, Phoebe Thomas, and Mila Zhou.\nFind our interactive Shiny App and report here: https://lilabethsoko.shinyapps.io/FinalProjApp/\nR code is included in the index section."

    "text": "I am a data science and English double major in my second year at Macalester College. As a student, I endeavor to bridge the divide between STEM and the humanities: my coursework includes Python, object oriented programming, data science, and statistical modeling, as well as various literature and creative writing studies.\nStories have called to me for as long as I can remember. As a child, my father and I had a tradition of completing my math lessons at the bookstore every week, after which I was allowed to select a new book. Eventually, I came to realize that I love to find the stories in numbers and data as well as fantastical worlds.\nOutside of the classroom, I am a captain of Macalesterâ€™s club quadball team and an avid West Coast Swing dancer. I also enjoy baking, long walks, and good music."
