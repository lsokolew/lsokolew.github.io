## About me

I am a data science and English double major in my second year at Macalester College. As a student, I endeavor to bridge the divide between STEM and the humanities: my coursework includes Python, object oriented programming, data science, and statistical modeling, as well as various literature and creative writing studies.

Stories have called to me for as long as I can remember. As a child, my father and I had a tradition of completing my math lessons at the bookstore every week, after which I was allowed to select a new book. Eventually, I came to realize that I love to find the stories in numbers and data as well as fantastical worlds.

Outside of the classroom, I am a captain of Macalester's club [quadball](https://www.mlquadball.com/what-is-quadball) team and an avid West Coast Swing dancer. I also enjoy baking, long walks, and good music.
